In YAML, **objects** are a type of complex data structure used to represent collections of key-value pairs, also known as **dictionaries** or **maps**. They are fundamental for organizing structured data. Here's a detailed overview of how objects work in YAML:

### Basic Object (Dictionary/Map)

An object in YAML is represented by a collection of key-value pairs. Keys are strings, and values can be of any YAML data type (including other objects). 

```yaml
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  email: john.doe@example.com
```

In this example:
- `person` is the key.
- The value of `person` is another object containing keys `name`, `age`, and `email`.

### Nested Objects

Objects can be nested inside other objects to represent hierarchical data.

```yaml
company:
  name: Tech Corp
  address:
    street: 123 Elm St
    city: Springfield
    state: IL
    postal_code: 62704
  employees:
    - name: Alice Smith
      position: Developer
    - name: Bob Johnson
      position: Manager
```

In this example:
- `company` contains nested objects for `address` and a list of `employees`.

### Objects with Lists

Objects can include lists as values, which is useful for representing multiple items or entries.

```yaml
library:
  name: Central Library
  location: Downtown
  books:
    - title: "To Kill a Mockingbird"
      author: Harper Lee
    - title: "1984"
      author: George Orwell
```

Here:
- `library` is an object with `books` as a list of objects.

### Objects with Complex Structures

YAML objects can represent more complex structures with nested lists and dictionaries.

```yaml
school:
  name: Green Valley High
  departments:
    science:
      head: Dr. Smith
      staff:
        - name: Alice
          role: Teacher
        - name: Bob
          role: Lab Technician
    arts:
      head: Ms. Johnson
      staff:
        - name: Charlie
          role: Teacher
        - name: Dana
          role: Assistant
```

### Using Aliases and Anchors

YAML allows the reuse of objects with anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`).

```yaml
defaults: &defaults
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3

service1:
  <<: *defaults
  url: http://service1.example.com

service2:
  <<: *defaults
  url: http://service2.example.com
```

In this example:
- `defaults` is an object defined with an anchor.
- `service1` and `service2` use the alias to include the `defaults` settings and add their own specific properties.

### Custom Object Types

YAML supports custom object types using tags. Custom tags can represent specific data structures or types beyond standard YAML objects.

```yaml
!custom_object
key1: value1
key2: value2
```

In this example:
- `!custom_object` is a custom tag indicating a specific type of object.

### Summary

- **Objects (Dictionaries/Maps)**: Key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be any YAML data type.
- **Nested Objects**: Objects within objects for hierarchical data.
- **Objects with Lists**: Objects containing lists as values.
- **Complex Structures**: Objects can include nested lists and dictionaries.
- **Aliases and Anchors**: Reuse of objects using `&` (anchor) and `*` (alias).
- **Custom Object Types**: YAML allows custom types with tags.

These features make YAML a flexible format for representing a wide range of structured data.
