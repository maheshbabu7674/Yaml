In YAML, placeholders are not a built-in feature of the language itself but are often used in conjunction with other tools and systems that consume YAML files. They serve as a way to insert dynamic values or configurations into YAML documents. Here’s an overview of how placeholders are typically used and managed in YAML:

### Using Placeholders in YAML

1. **Placeholder Syntax**

   Placeholders are usually represented by variables or special strings that are replaced with actual values by external tools or during processing. The exact syntax for placeholders can vary depending on the tool or system.

   ```yaml
   database:
     host: ${DB_HOST}
     port: ${DB_PORT}
     username: ${DB_USER}
     password: ${DB_PASS}
   ```

   In this example, `${DB_HOST}`, `${DB_PORT}`, `${DB_USER}`, and `${DB_PASS}` are placeholders that will be substituted with actual values during runtime or deployment.

2. **Tool-Specific Placeholders**

   Different tools and systems use their own syntax for placeholders:

   - **Terraform**: Uses `${var.variable_name}` for variables.

     ```yaml
     resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
       bucket = "${var.bucket_name}"
       acl    = "private"
     }
     ```

   - **Ansible**: Uses `{{ variable_name }}` for variables.

     ```yaml
     - name: Ensure the database is running
       ansible.builtin.service:
         name: "{{ db_service_name }}"
         state: started
     ```

   - **Azure Pipelines**: Uses `$(variable_name)` for variables.

     ```yaml
     steps:
     - script: echo $(BuildConfiguration)
       displayName: 'Print Build Configuration'
     ```

   - **GitHub Actions**: Uses `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` for secrets.

     ```yaml
     env:
       DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
     ```

3. **Placeholder Resolution**

   Placeholders are typically resolved by:

   - **Environment Variables**: Values are substituted based on environment variables set in the system or deployment environment.

     ```yaml
     database:
       host: ${DATABASE_HOST}
       port: ${DATABASE_PORT}
     ```

   - **Configuration Management Tools**: Tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Helm substitute placeholders with values from their configuration files or runtime parameters.

   - **Template Engines**: Systems that use YAML templates (e.g., Jinja2 for Ansible) will replace placeholders with actual values during template rendering.

4. **Example in a CI/CD Pipeline**

   Here’s an example of using placeholders in a CI/CD pipeline configuration with Azure Pipelines:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       include:
         - main

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   variables:
     buildConfiguration: 'Release'
     version: '1.0.0'

   steps:
   - script: echo Building $(buildConfiguration) version $(version)
     displayName: 'Print Build Information'
   ```

   In this example:
   - `$(buildConfiguration)` and `$(version)` are placeholders for variables defined in the pipeline.

5. **Placeholders in Helm Charts**

   Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, uses placeholders in its `values.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   replicaCount: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
   image:
     repository: {{ .Values.image.repository }}
     tag: {{ .Values.image.tag }}
   ```

   In this example:
   - `{{ .Values.replicaCount }}`, `{{ .Values.image.repository }}`, and `{{ .Values.image.tag }}` are placeholders replaced with values from the `values.yaml` file or overridden during deployment.

### Summary

- **Placeholders** in YAML are used to insert dynamic values or configurations.
- **Syntax** varies by tool, such as `${VAR_NAME}`, `{{ var_name }}`, or `$VARIABLE_NAME`.
- **Resolution** is handled by environment variables, configuration management tools, or template engines.
- **Examples** include CI/CD pipelines, configuration management tools, and Helm charts.

Placeholders help make YAML configurations flexible and reusable by allowing dynamic value substitution.
